For the 2021 edition, exec(ut) was streamed from the Social Impact Factory (SIF) in Utrecht due to COVID-19 restrictions. Please note that SIF is located inside de Utrechter, making it a unique and accessible venue in the heart of Utrecht.

SIF is the hotspot for social entrepreneurship in Utrecht. They provide an event space (our 'studio') and smaller offices where entrepreneurs can work on their brightest ideas. With SIF's focus on social entrepreneurship, they perfectly aligned with our more sustainable vision at exec(ut).

The Social Impact Factory served as an excellent streaming venue, providing the technical infrastructure needed to deliver high-quality online content to our digital audience. This partnership demonstrated how physical and digital spaces can come together to create meaningful experiences, even during challenging times.
