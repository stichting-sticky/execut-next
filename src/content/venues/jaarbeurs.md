The 2020 edition of exec(ut) took place at the famous Jaarbeurs in Utrecht, located just a stone's throw away from Utrecht Central Station. We had access to both Polar and Flame throughout the day, with Polar serving as our main conference hall and Flame as the networking area and bar zone.

Polar features a clean, white aesthetic that perfectly aligned with exec(ut)'s futuristic theme. After captivating talks in Polar, attendees were welcomed by the cozy warmth of the Flame foyer, creating the perfect environment for networking and informal discussions.
