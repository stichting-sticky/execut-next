Flint, formerly known as De Flint, is a renowned theatre in the centre of Amersfoort, Netherlands, built in 1977. Designed by Onno Greiner, the venue typically hosts plays, musicals, cabaret, and performances for children. For exec(ut) 2022, this cultural landmark transformed into our conference stage.

We were provided with dedicated spaces for talks, workshops, and a comfortable lounge area where we hosted lunch, dinner, and company stands. The venue offered the perfect environment for attendees to take breaks between talks, network with friends, and engage with our partner companies in a relaxed and inspiring setting.
