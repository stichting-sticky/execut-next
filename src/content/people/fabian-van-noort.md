Fabian has a heart for digital and for people. After having been immersed in studying the tech side of things, he turned to cognitive psychology to understand the human side of tech. Working as a design researcher at Valsplat, he helps teams and organisations in empathising with the human side of their digital products. Extensive interviewing to understand what people need, diving into Google Analytics to see how people tend to behave and conducting user testing to find out why people behave the way they do is all in a day's work.
