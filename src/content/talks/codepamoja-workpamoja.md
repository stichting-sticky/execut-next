speaker: andy-haxby

Collaborating with partners in Africa for more than 10 years, Competa IT has found that we can increase the success of African ICT projects by sharing our knowledge, introducing African developers not only to the tech we use (they can find that online) but also how we approach software development using tools, teamwork and management techniques. This presentation will demonstrate how people and companies in the EU can proactively help Africans use technology to meet African social and environmental challenges.
