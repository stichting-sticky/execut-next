Technology is one of the key drivers of competition in trading these days. A modern quantitative trading operation uses FPGAs for low latency, clouds for machine learning & massive storage systems for data; all coupled together with mix of open and closed source systems.

This talk will take you on a journey through this world, starting all the way at the beginning with the basics of trading and the laws of supply and demand. From there out we'll take a look at why latency is important. And why do you need this machine learning anyway?

At the end of the story, I'm going to look at the human side. Because no matter how big the stack of technology, it's all built and operated by engineers - like you'll be. Over the years we have found that some engineers are successful at most problems while others just seem to get stuck; the difference is a surprisingly small set of traits and principles.
