title: Data sketches | a year of exotic data visualizations
speaker: nadieh-bremer
---

"data sketches" was a year-long collaboration between Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu, both freelancing data visualisation designers. Each month they chose a topic and visualised it in an overly elaborate & geeky manner. But besides sharing the end result, they also wrote extensively about the creation process. In this talk, Nadieh will share her most important lessons learned in the fundamental areas of data, sketching & coding the visual onto the screen. About how some months became favourites, what mistakes were made along the way, and how they were overcome. She'll especially highlight that many visualizations had humble, ugly duckling beginnings, but that through many (embarrassing) iterations they were turned into unique and, hopefully, compelling results. And finally, she'll touch upon the impact & benefit of collaborating heavily with someone (halfway across the globe) for a year.
