title: 'Big data to big impact: redefining chronic disease with real-world evidence'

The Low Carb Program is a behaviour change platform for people with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes and obesity that is redefining metabolic health. Peer-reviewed, published outcomes demonstrate that the Low Carb Program is more effective than first-line medication for type 2 diabetes - and what's more, it places the condition into remission for 26% of patients at 1-year. Localized in three markets, the platform is incentivizing wellness and providing hope to over 380,000 patients through insurance companies, health agencies and National Health Services.

The talk will explore how the Low Carb Program is augmenting traditional healthcare - and the concerns, intertias, ethics and considerations encountered as DDM develop a new form of medication - digital therapeutics; and how real-world evidence is rewriting the clinical textbooks.
