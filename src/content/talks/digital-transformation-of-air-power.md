Within every aspect of providing Air Power to the Dutch military, the Royal Netherlands Air Force, utilizes Command and Control (C2) systems. These complex socio-technical systems combine well trained human operators, and information processing technology, following well-defined procedures to coordinate the required tasks to complete the mission. In the case of the Royal Netherlands Air Force this mission is to provide 24/7 protection for Dutch airspace and deliver air power where ever and whenever that is needed.

During our time together we will dive into the importance of command and control systems and their integration into modern IT infrastructures. Firstly we will explore the ever evolving role of C2 systems in today’s digital landscape. Secondly, the task-oriented focus of a C2 system. And lastly, the subject of decision support systems and networks will be discussed.

This will ensure attendees will gain insights into the challenges and innovations shaping the future of command and control in an increasingly connected world.
