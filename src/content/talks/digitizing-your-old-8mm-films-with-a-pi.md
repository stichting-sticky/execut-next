Until the late 80’s consumers used film like super 8 to record their own films, but not a lot of equipment survived to play them back or people don’t want to setup a projector and screen for a few minutes of movie. There are a lot of companies that can scan you movie and put it on a hard disk or dvd. But how hard can it be to do it yourself?

After this talk you will know what it takes to digitize your own films code wise and how to build a rig to facilitate this.

Some topics that will be touched upon: using a scanner with a PI, image processing (on a PI), resource management, lessons learned.
