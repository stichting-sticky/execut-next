In this inspiring talk, Brenno de Winter takes you into the world of the validation crisis, where unchecked assumptions and blind trust in systems lead to major misunderstandings—and sometimes even catastrophic consequences.

Through compelling stories—including a confusing hotel experience in Singapore, the dangers of digital spoofing, mistrained AI models, and pitfalls in organizational decision-making—he reveals how our daily actions are shaped by a lack of critical validation steps.

Discover how asking the right questions, challenging assumptions, and fostering a culture of transparent and evidence-based decision-making can be the key to building a more resilient and reality-driven society.
