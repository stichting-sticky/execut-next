About 4% of the population has some form of color blindness. One in 12 men and 1 in 200 women are color blind and face challenges with a lot of online products like websites, apps, games, and webshops in their daily life. Thankfully, designing for the colorblind doesn't have to be difficult. In this talk, Tom explains how color blindness works, gives examples of what does and doesn't work for the colorblind and shows how designing with the colorblind in mind will also improve your design for everyone.
