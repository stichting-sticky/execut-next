In this talk, we'll explore our role, as humans, in human-centered artificial intelligence. We will dive into artificial intelligence and how the field is shifting from technological towards humanistic; from focusing on algorithmic performance towards focusing on human performance. Nathalie will share the story behind DEUS, and how you can approach AI projects in a human(ity)-centered way.
