title: "Everything is Anything: The Unlikely Wisdom of Historical Stabbings"

This is not a talk about stabbing people. Violence is bad. But it is a talk about two people who tried to stab each other hundreds of years ago. It's also a talk about getting inspiration from unlikely sources. About how skills might not be transferable but mastering a skill could be. About how, when the chips are down, anything can be everything.
