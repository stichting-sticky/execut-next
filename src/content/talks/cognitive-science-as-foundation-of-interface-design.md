For some design and product teams, evaluation methods, such as A/B testing or user testing, is the only way to understand whether their interface is clear to users or not. In her talk, Tatiana will show how the application of cognitive science principles in the design process can help achieve a higher quality of the user interface right away. She will walk us through the human information process, elaborate on specifics of basic cognitive processes and explain how to use this knowledge in interface design.
