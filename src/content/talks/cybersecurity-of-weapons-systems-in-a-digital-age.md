Digital technology has been increasingly used in nuclear and conventional weapons systems widely. Such use poses cybersecurity risks that may impact both military planning and political decision-making.

Realising that cyber is not only a technical issue, the speaker is going to introduce the political considerations of cybersecurity of weapons systems.

In this talk, the speaker will examine existing cyber threats, vulnerabilities and consequences to weapons systems. She will make recommendations for the military and political cadre.
