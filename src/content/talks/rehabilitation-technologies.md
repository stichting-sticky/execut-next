This presentation discusses how rehabilitation technology has developed in recent years. Robotics has ensured that several training robots have been developed to support rehabilitation treatment. In addition, developments in rehabilitation technology are very important for the personal support of people with disabilities. Exo skeletons, prosthetics of lower and upper extremities are more and more important to enhance people with a disability to participate in work and sports. Several examples and personal experience of the presenter will be shown. Also, further development leads to the question: is the technology better than the original?
