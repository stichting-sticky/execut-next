One evening in 2018, Dylan Beattie sat down in a bar, opened a laptop, and wrote a joke: a parody specification for a programming language based on 1980s rock songs. Seven years later, Rockstar has shown up everywhere from Classic Rock magazine to Carnegie Mellon University, and each time, it attracts a new wave of aspiring Rockstar developers, with ideas, questions and suggestions… and so one evening in 2024, Dylan sat down in another bar, opened another laptop, and Rockstar 2.0 was born. It’s a project which combines C#, JavaScript, browser APIs, and web assembly, building on decades of research in parser engineering and asynchronous application development — and it's still based on Bon Jovi songs.

This is the story of Rockstar 2.0. You'll learn about the history of esoteric programming languages, and what's involved in creating an entirely new programming language. You'll see a lot of cool tech… and you'll marvel at just how much engineering can go into one joke.
