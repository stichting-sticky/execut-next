speaker: joost-van-dongen

Programming well is an art, but can programming also be used to make art? In this talk Joost will show that with the right mindset, code is a tool for creative expression, in no way less capable of producing art than a brush, pencil or musical instrument. He will show a few examples of the art he has made through code: from abstract visuals, to an automated composer, to the live performance video game Cello Fortress.
